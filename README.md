# Pomodro timer

The Pomodro Techinque is a method for staying focused and mentally fresh. The concept is:

1. You pick a task for yourself
2. Set a 25-minute timer
3. Work on the task until the time is up
4. Take a 5 minute break
5. Repeat and every 4 pomodros, take a longer 15-30 minute break

I wanted to create this project because is personally use the pomodro technique and all the other Pomodro Timers in the market lack the aesthetics and features I want to use.
